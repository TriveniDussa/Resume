    <h2>🕉️ Introduction</h2>
    <p>The <b>Ayodhya Ram Mandir</b> stands not just as a temple, but as a timeless emblem of India’s cultural and spiritual identity. Situated on the sacred banks of the <b>Saryu River</b>, Ayodhya has been revered for centuries as the birthplace of <b>Lord Ram</b>, the embodiment of righteousness and dharma.

The construction of the grand Ram Mandir marks a historic moment — a culmination of centuries of devotion, patience, and perseverance by millions of devotees across the world.</p>

    <h2>🏛️ The Journey Through Time</h2>
    <p>The story of Ayodhya Ram Mandir is deeply rooted in India’s ancient history. References to Ayodhya appear in scriptures like the <b>Ramayana</b>, <b>Skanda Purana</b>, and <b>Atharva Veda</b>, describing it as a divine city where dharma flourished under Lord Ram’s rule.

For centuries, the site remained a focal point of faith. After long-standing legal and social debates, the <b>Supreme Court of India’s 2019 verdict</b> paved the way for the temple’s construction — ensuring justice, peace, and unity.

On <b>August 5, 2020</b>, Prime Minister <b>Narendra Modi</b> laid the foundation stone (Bhoomi Pujan), marking a new chapter in Indian history.</p>

            <li><b>Height:</b> Approximately 161 feet</li>
            <li><b>Length:</b> Around 360 feet</li>
            <li><b>Width:</b> About 235 feet</li>
